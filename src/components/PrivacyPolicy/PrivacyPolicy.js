              We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
              sensitive information via the website, your information is
              protected both online and offline.<br></br>
              Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as name and date
              of birth), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in
              a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in
              the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the
              address of the Web page.<br></br>

              transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only
              employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
              example, billing or customer service) are granted access to
              personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in
              which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a
              secure environment.

              information to contact you. The contact information collected
